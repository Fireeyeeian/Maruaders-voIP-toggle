# Maruaders voip toggle
 A work around for toggling voIP always on
 
 ...
 
•Make sure voIP is set to push to talk

•Double press capslock in game to toggle voIP to an open state

•When red dot is showing at the bottom voIP is open

•Also note that MARUADERS shows a wave form at the top left of the screen to show when mic is being transmitted 


**SMALL BUG: If you alt+tab while transmitting via this it will need to be re toggled on when you get back to the game even if red dot is showing.
